# What is signal
1. Django includes a “signal dispatcher” which helps allow decoupled(separate) applications get notified when actions occur  
elsewhere in the framework.  

# Sender and receiver 
2. There are two key elements in the signals machinary : the senders and the receivers. As the name suggests, the sender   
is the one responsible to dispatch a signal, and the receiver is the one who will receive this signal and then do something.    
3. The connection between the senders and the receivers is done through “signal dispatchers”, which are instances of   
Signal, via the connect method.  
 
# Example 
1. This code is writen in `app_name/model.py`.    
2. post_save built-in signal. Its code lives in the django.db.models.signals module. This particular signal fires right    
after a model finish executing its save method.  
``` 
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models.signals import post_save

def create_profile(sender, **kwargs):
    if kwargs['created']:
        Users_Profile = UserProfile.objects.create(user=kwargs['instance'])

post_save.connect(create_profile, sender=User)
``` 
# Explain 
1. User is the sender.   
2. post_save is the signal.  
3. create_profile() is our receiver function.  
4. post_save.connect(create_profile), the create_profile function will be executed after any Django model executes the create method.  
5. Every time when a User is create new user in user database it appear in userprofile database.
