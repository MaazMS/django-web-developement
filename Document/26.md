# What are generic views  
1. When building a web application there are certain kind of views that we build again and again, such as a view that   
displays all records in the database, (e.g., displaying all books in the books table), etc.  
2. These kinds of views perform the same functions and lead to repeated code.  
3. To solve this issue, Django uses class-based generic views.  
# from django.views.generic import TemplateView
1. create class and inherit TemplateView.   
2. define template name `template_name = 'home/home.html'`       
``` 
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class HomeView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'home/home.html'
```
# function `as_view()`  handle request and return view.  
1. as_view function use in `app_name/urls.py`  
2. It is use to handle request and return view.    
``` 
from django.conf.urls import url
from home.views  import HomeView
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$',HomeView.as_view(), name='Home' )
]
```
