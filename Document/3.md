# What is Django Templates?  
Generate dynamic HTML pages by using its template system.  
A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic    
content will be inserted.   
# Why Django Template? 
1. In HTML file, we can't write python code because the code is only interpreted by python interpreter not the browser.  
2. We know that HTML is a static markup language, while Python is a dynamic programming language.  
3. Django template engine is used to separate the design from the python code and allows us to build dynamic web pages.  
# Structure of template   
1. inside the app of django create folder `templates`.  
In that templates folder we create html pages.  
# Advance structure of template   
1. create html page inside of templates but for separate purpose.   
2. `account` is one app and `filter` is another app.  
````  
Example 
templates 
    accounts
        user_profile.html
        update_user_profile.html
    filter
        change_password.html
        rest_passord.html
````  
# How to map templates  
1. Define logic of template in app_name/views.py  
    a. Define function which is return request, template location and file name with extension, dictionary object which is optional)   
 ``` 
example 
def fun_name(request):
    erturn render (request, 'accounts/user_profile.html, dictionary_object)
 ```

2.TO map the template or create url for template in app_name/urls.py.  
 a. from django.conf.urls import url 
 b. from . import views  
 c. Define the url path, view.function_name , 
``` 
example 
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views  

urlpatterns = [  
    url(r'^welcome/', views.welcome), 
]
```
