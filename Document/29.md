1. What is Django ORM?
ORM stands for Object-relational Mapper. Instead of interacting with the database by writing raw SQL queries and    
converting the data returned from the query into a Python object, ORM allows us to interact with the database using     
objects of our model class. So, we just interact with our models and ORM converts these changes into SQL queries based   
on the database we are using, e.g., SQLite.  

1. What is Django Session?  
A session is a mechanism to store information on the server side during the interaction with the web application.        
By default, session stores in the database and also allows file-based and cache based sessions.   

1. What is the role of Cookie in Django?
A cookie is a small piece of information which is stored in the client browser.    
It is used to store user's data in a file permanently (or for the specified time).    
Cookie has its expiry date and time and removes automatically when gets expire.   
Django provides built-in methods to set_cookie to set cookie and get use to get cookie.  
example 
````   
response.set_cookie('logged_in_status', 'never_use_this_ever') 
return response  
request.COOKIES.get('logged_in_status') # remember, this is a terrible idea.
````
